<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The Linear Regression Model showcases a classic case of overfitting
- The optimal value of alpha is determined to tune the hyperparameters of Ridge and Lasso
- It is concluded that Lasso Regression model in this case is the a better model among Linear, Ridge and Lasso Regression.
